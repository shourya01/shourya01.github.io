Hi, I am Shourya Bose. I am a PhD candidate with the [eODAL Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~yzhan419/group.html) at University of California, Santa Cruz. My advisor is [Dr. Yu Zhang](https://people.ucsc.edu/~yzhan419). 

My research interests span the intersection of optimization, control theory, and machine learning, with their applications in smart distribution grids and microgrids.

Previously I was a Research Associate (RA) at the Department of Electrical Engineering
at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru in the [Control and Network Systems Group](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/pavant/group.html).

I graduated with a Dual Degree from BITS Pilani (KK Birla Goa Campus) on December, 2019. I majored in M.Sc. (_Hons._) Mathematics, and B.E. (_Hons._) Electrical and
Electronics Engineering. I graduated with a First Class grade in both the subjects.

# Other Works

### Pixxel Space

I worked as a research intern at Pixxel Space. Pixxel is aiming to launch a constellation of earth observing satellites and revolutionize space-based data collection by using it to solve day-to-day problems.

As a part of the company, I was involved in spacecraft orbit simulation.

I also gained exposure to softwares such as NASA's GMAT, AGI's STK, and a.i. Solutions' FreeFlyer.

### Multibeam Satellite Precoding

I undertook a graded Design Project at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus. As a part of
the project, I understood the concept of signal power management and precoding in communication systems. I also proposed a few methods for efficient
precoding in a SATCOM (Satellite Communication) system.

# Miscellaneous

### Science Internship Program 2021

I was a mentor for the Science Internship Program (SIP) 2021 organized by UCSC. The program organizes two-month interships for high-school students under the mentorship of UCSC graduate researchers in an apprentiship mode. This helps the high-school students gain an early exposure to research. I mentored my cohort of 3 students in the field of energy data analytics using Python.

### Hult Prize 2016 (Dubai Finals)

Hult Prize is an annual entrepreneurship competition organized on a global scale to encourage innovative entrepreneurial solutions to large-scale social problems.

I was a part of _Project Vriddhi_, a team of 4 BITS Pilani, Goa students. We proposed an idea for urban decongestion using scheduled & shared transportation.
This was in response to solve the problem of [urban crowded slums](http://www.hultprize.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hult-Prize-2016-Case-Study_FINAL.compressed.pdf),
which was the Hult Prize Challenge for 2016. 

Our model included spatial decongestion of slums by an innovtive transport management system, which would include app notifications/SMS alerts for the employed residents,
which would be networked with the employers and transport vehicles. This would allow precise co-ordination of manpower through networked transportation, even if the 
job requirement was far away from the slum. This would enable the slum-dwelling labour to become competitive in the job market and earn a respectable living.

We implemented a prototype in the Zari slum of Goa, and the results allowed us to win the Hult Regional Finals held in Goa. We then presented our idea at the Dubai finals
in front of eminent investors, technocrats, and social workers.
