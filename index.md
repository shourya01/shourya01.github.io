Hi, I am Shourya Bose. I am a PhD candidate with the [eODAL Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~yzhan419/group.html) at University of California, Santa Cruz. My advisor is [Dr. Yu Zhang](https://people.ucsc.edu/~yzhan419). My research interests span the intersection of machine learning and optimization applied to electric power systems. Within machine learning, my works deal with **foundation models**, **reinforcement learning**, and **machine-learning aided optimization**.

Previously I was a Research Associate (RA) at the Department of Electrical Engineering
at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru in the [Control and Network Systems Group](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/pavant/group.html).

I graduated with a Dual Degree from BITS Pilani (KK Birla Goa Campus) on December, 2019. I majored in M.Sc. (_Hons._) Mathematics, and B.E. (_Hons._) Electrical and
Electronics Engineering. I graduated with a First Class grade in both the subjects.

# Domain Experience

### Machine Learning
As a part of my Ph.D. research and an internship at **Argonne National Laboratory**, I have carried out significant research on various aspects of machine learning applied to electric power systems. I have researched (and won an international competition) on the application of **reinforcement learning** for operation of power grids. I worked on the problem of **load forecasting** using **time-series foundation models**, and am currently concluding a project wherein I designed adapters for merging time-series foundation models with **weather foundation models** to create **weather-informed load forecasters**. Lastly, I worked on **machine-learning accelerators for optimization problems** which involved creating mixture-of-experts models that accelerate optimization problems by eliminating non-informative constraints, with each expert having a good understanding of different kinds of non-informative constraints.

### Numerical Optimization
I have conducted research on different kinds optimization problems with applications for electric power systems. These works can broadly be divided into two categories - **proposing new problem structures** and **solving existing problems more efficiently**. With respect to the former, I have worked **co-optimization of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with load restoration**, and **privacy-preserving load restoration using customer batteries**. With respect to the former, please see the Machine Learning section for work on accelerating optimization problems using neural networks.

### Formal Methods
I am currently enrolled in a graduate-level formal methods course. As a part of the same, I am working on two different projects:
- Formally verifying safety of nonlinear control systems using reachability analysis.
- Formally verifying machine learning proxies for Optimal Power Flow using $\alpha$-CROWN.

### Control Theory
I have worked on event-triggered control of linear systems over noisy channels between the sensor and the controller, resulting in a journal publication. I have also taken graduate courses on nonlinear and optimal control.

# Competition Victories

### INFORMS Data Challenge 2025 - First Position

Internation competition with over 40 teams with the objective of forecasting electrical outages for 83 counties in Michigan over the span of 48 hours. Our team (myself, Tomas Kaljevic, Yu Zhang) preented a solution based on a two-stage forecasting model powered by gradient boosted decision trees.

### Learning to Run a Power Grid (L2RPN), 2023 - First Position

International competition with over 90 participants with the objective of using reinforcement learning based techniques to operate a simulated power grid for 24 hours. Our team (myself, Qiuling Yang, Yu Zhang) presented a solution which used a mixture of classical optimization, Monte Carlo search, and policy optimization. 

# Miscellaneous

### Scholarships and Fellowships

As a part of my PhD journey, I am the grateful recipient of two competitive scholarships - the **Chancellor's Fellowship** covering the first year of my research, and the **Dissertation-Year Fellowship** covering the final year of my studies.

### Space

I am a huge space enthusiast! While I mostly follow space launches and space science in a private capacity, I had the opportunity to contribute to Pixxel Space as an intern in 2019. As a part of that internship, I understood some of the factors behind sizing and orbit choice for a constellation of earth observation satellites.
